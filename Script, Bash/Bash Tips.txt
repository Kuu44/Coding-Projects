Any command that can be run in the terminal can be run in a bash script.
Variables are assigned using an equals sign with no space (greeting="hello").
Variables are accessed using a dollar sign (echo $greeting).

Conditionals use if, then, else, fi syntax.

Three types of loops can be used: for, while, and until.

Bash scripts use a unique set of comparison operators:
Equal: -eq
Not equal: -ne
Less than or equal: -le
Less than: -lt
Greater than or equal: -ge
Greater than: -gt
Is null: -z

Input arguments can be passed to a bash script after the script name, 
separated by spaces (myScript.sh “hello” “how are you”).
Input can be requested from the script user with the read keyword.
Aliases can be created in the .bashrc or .bash_profile using the alias keyword.
