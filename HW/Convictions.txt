Convictions (N.=conviction, -=rating, >=what i lost, >>=what i could gain)

Would be completely believable to anyone. Wouldnt need to create more and
more unnecessary lies to cover up
>>>I'm still okay. I reverted akmost all to gorund zero and starting from 
scratch again. The ugly lies will remain, but will slowly get buried. Many
things are working out and even when i confronted my best friend about it
it all settled down and he accepted me, hell was proud of me for it. Told me
