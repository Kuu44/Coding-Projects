1. Allow Concurrency whenever possible.
2. if(integer==0) x if(!integer) \/
3. Main things to look when writing a function is

a) The function should not exceed 15 lines of code,
b) If a small functionality comes on the middle of the logic, move that functionality to a function so 
that you can access it for other logics and this will reduce some lines of code with a single line.,
c) The code should be properly intended, because when some other person who doesn’t have 
prior knowledge of the flow, when he/she looks into the code, the first look should not make them 
confuse.
d) Proper commenting before the functions, expressions will help other developer to grasp the 
flow easily.,

Debugging: 
1. Check that when accessing properties, you dont add " () "
2. In for loops, check that the stopping condition isnt
 modified in the loop itself

Separation of concerns: means organizing code into distinct sections each 
handling a specific task. It enables us to quickly navigate our code and 
know where to look if something isn’t working.
